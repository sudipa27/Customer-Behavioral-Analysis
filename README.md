<h1>Behavorial Analysis of Restaurant Customers using SQL</h1>
<hr>
<h2>
  Objective :
</h2> In this project, we conducted a behavioral analysis of restaurant customers using a dummy restaurant data set. The primary objective was to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and trends, enabling the restaurant to enhance its marketing strategies, optimize menu offerings, and improve overall customer experience.
<br>
<h2>SQL Queries:</h2>
Using SQL, we performed various queries and transformations to answer specific questions about customer behavior. Some of the SQL queries used in the analysis include:
<ul>
  <li>Customer Segmentation: We performed clustering analysis using SQL to segment customers based on their order frequency and total spending, allowing us to identify high-value, loyal customers.</li>
  <li>Top-Selling Items: We utilized SQL aggregation functions to identify the top-selling menu items, helping the restaurant focus on popular dishes and optimize inventory management.</li>
  <li>Customer Retention Rate: Using SQL subqueries, we calculated the customer retention rate over time, providing insights into customer loyalty and repeat visits.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Insights and Recommendations:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The top-selling menu items were identified, allowing the restaurant to focus on the most profitable dishes.</li>
  <li>Customer segmentation revealed a group of loyal customers, presenting an opportunity for targeted marketing campaigns and loyalty programs</li>
</ul>
